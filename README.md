## Prediapp

Mobile application to manage geographic, cadastral and appraisal information. Looking to find the best way to optimize the time and cost.
The app doesn't have a backend implementation. Just the front, it handles the state with ngrx and observables!.

### Features :sparkles:
- Login and register module.
- Manage the user information.
- Maps with geographic information about your houses!.
- Create and review visits.
- Logout.


### Made with :construction_worker:
- Ionic 5
- Angular 10
- Ngrx
- MaterialDesign 
- Leaflet
- Capacitor
- Cordova
- Rxjs


If you want to contribute to improve the app, please create your PR and write to me :alien: . After it, sit down and take a beer, you deserve it! :beers:
